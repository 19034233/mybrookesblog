Much like the typographic design for *Moana,* the typography for *Brave* draws heavily on historical and cultural influences. As soon as I saw the film poster, I could tell that the story was set in Celtic Scotland, simply from the typography. As someone who is half-Scottish, I am very familiar with Celtic typographic design, which can be found on Shortbread tins, Whiskey bottles and tartan clothing labels. However, I realised that I know very little about the origins of this typography.
