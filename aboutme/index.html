	<p class="few_things_text">Here are a few things about me...</p>

</div>


<!-- // Facts // -->
<div class="facts">

	<p>I am a second-year undergraduate studying <span class="highlight">Media, Publishing and Journalism.</span>
	I chose this degree because I have always loved writing, reading and watching films. If I could do a job which involved any of these things, I'd be very happy! I can see myself being a columnist, film critic, or working for a children's publishing house. I'm sure I'll figure it out.
If you'd like to read some of my writing, you can have a look at my personal blog <a class="fact_link" href="https://anna-writes.wixsite.com/annawrites" target="blank">Anna Writes</a>.</p>

	<!-- Cope and paste your favourite emoji from here: https://textfancy.com/emoji/ -->
	<p>My favourite emoji is &#127752; because I love all things colourful. I have the wardrobe of a children's tv presenter and will wear almost any colour.</p>

	<p>The last book I read was <a class="fact_link" href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/hag/daisy-johnson/kirsty-logan/9780349013596" target="blank">Hag.</a>
		It's a collection of folktales retold by female authors. It was also recorded as an audiobook, which I listened to alongside the text.
		It was the perfect spooky, autumnal read and I'd highly recommend.</p>

	<!-- Picture -->
	<p>Here is <span class="highlight">a picture of me with my friends:</span>
		<img class="fact_image" src="img/friends.jpg">
	I met most of my close friends at university. It's really nice to have friends with so many common interests. Before the pandemic, we all loved cooking meals together and having days out in Oxford. Since I am now doing remote learning, I haven't seen any of them since March. I miss them very much!</p>

	<p>I really enjoy <span class="highlight">reading books indoors when it's raining outside.</span> I have a part-time job as a bookseller at Waterstones, so I always have more than enough to read. I've worked in Waterstones Oxford, Witney, High Wycombe and Aylesbury, which is where I currently work.</p>

	<!-- Public Figure List -->
	<p>Three public figures I keep updated on are</p>

	<ul class="public_figures_list">

		<li><a class="fact_link" href="https://twitter.com/RealMatBaynton" target="blank">Mat Baynton</a></li>

		<p>Mat Baynton is a writer, comedian and actor but was also, more importantly, my first crush. I'm unashamed to say I follow him on twitter...eleven years later.</p>

		<li><a class="fact_link" href="https://twitter.com/MichelleObama" target="blank">Michelle Obama</a></li>

		<p>I really believe that Michelle Obama should rule the world. I find her completely inspirational, and I think everyone should read her book <a class="fact_link" href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/becoming/michelle-obama/9780241334140" target="blank">Becoming</a>.</p>

		<li><a class="fact_link" href="https://twitter.com/CaitLinMoran" target="blank">Caitlin Moran</a></li>

		<p>Caitlin Moran is both a feminist icon, a brilliant writer, and a really funny person. Her book <a class="fact_link" href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/how-to-be-a-woman/caitlin-moran/9780091940744" target="blank">How To Be A Woman</a> is hilarious and potentially life-changing. I'd love to be a columnist like she is.</p>

	</ul>

	<p class="fact">I know more than the average person about <span class="highlight">Horrible Histories!</span> Which is, incidentally, where my love for Mat Baynton started.</p>

	<p class="fact">A challenge I am facing is <span class="highlight">living with a rare heart condition.</span> I didn't know I had it until I was 12, and my world turned upside down. I've had heart surgery twice, and am expecting open heart surgery at some point in the future.
		When I was 14, I did lots of fundraising for the British Heart Foundation, and had a video and written blog called Heart Hobbies. The blog showed young heart patients different hobbies and activities which were heart-condition friendly.
		 I also wrote regular review and interview pieces for a couple of BHF magazines.
		 I was awarded a Gold Blue Peter Badge by Ewan Vinnicombe for my work, which is my highest and proudest achievement to date.</p>

	<p class="fact">Something exciting I have done is <span class="highlight">writing and directing a short film for Channel 4.</span> When I was 16, I had a succesful pitch with Screen South to make a 3 minute film for Channel 4. I worked with Resource Productions and a professional crew to produce the film, and edited it at Molinaire Studios.
		I was in charge of the entire process, from the design to storyboards, the script and shooting schedule, to scouting, auditioning and hiring actors and designing the film logo and branding. The finished film can be viewed <a class="fact_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpZualhBnKI&t=22s" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

	<p class="fact">In five years I hope <span class="highlight">I will be doing something that makes me happy.</span></p>
